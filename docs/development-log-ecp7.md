# Development Log ECP-7

The ECP-7 confirmatory test set remains sealed throughout all work recorded in
this log.

## Variant register

| Variant | Arm | Sender | Receiver | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ECP7-B1-C | Positive control | ECP-6 factor-local permutation slots | Factor-local classifier | completed; gate passed |
| ECP7-B1-I | Intervention | Joint-context bounded autoregressive | Generic sequence encoder | completed; gate failed |

No other ECP-7 variant has been trained.

## Batch 1 preregistration

Date: July 18, 2026<br>
Seed: `11`<br>
Maximum population steps: `5,000`<br>
Split-SHA-256: `4947058c75ab07cb43a87eb82776b12cb2a7e2eeba7114de110d3b852cbc64cd`<br>
Test unsealed: **no**

The batch compares the weak-structure intervention against the frozen ECP-6
architecture on the same new validation matching. The decision rules are fixed
in `docs/research-design-ecp7.md`. Smoke runs are mechanical checks only and do
not authorize tuning.

## Batch 1 results

| Metric | Positive control | Intervention |
|---|---:|---:|
| Population train, mean | 100% | 0.4312% |
| Population train, worst link | 100% | 0.3906% |
| Population validation, mean | 100% | 0.6287% |
| Population validation, worst link | 100% | 0.4883% |
| Universal translator, validation | 100% | 0.5371% |
| Unique messages per sender | 15,360 | 130–139 |
| Collision meanings per sender | 0 | 15,221–15,230 |
| Development gate | pass | **fail** |

The positive control passed its 99% batch-validity threshold for every link, so
the intervention failure cannot be attributed to the new split or execution
pipeline.

The intervention learned the two smaller factors but not the held-out pair
factors. Its population validation factor accuracies were approximately
`[6.80%, 6.58%, 100%, 100%]` for color, shape, size and texture. The universal
translator showed the same pattern: `[6.35%, 6.69%, 100%, 99.95%]`. Color and
shape are therefore near their 6.25% chance level, while size and texture are
almost exact.

All four intervention senders collapsed most of the 14-bit channel to only
130–139 distinct messages. Their message entropy was 6.43–6.47 bits over the
15,360 accessible meanings, versus 13.91 bits for the collision-free control.
The result is a failure of code utilization and compositional reconstruction,
not a wire-capacity violation.

## Integrity

Both analyses report:

- all 65 captured artifact hashes match;
- all 16,384 episode rows contain validation data only;
- no `compositional_test` metric or episode exists;
- every logged message declares exactly 14 bits;
- all symbols respect their local slot alphabet;
- isolated sender and receiver workers completed successfully.

The first intervention smoke attempt stopped during isolated checkpoint loading
because the worker's runtime sender-type allowlist did not yet include the new
class. No result or test data was produced. The allowlist was fixed, a
regression test was added, and the repeated mechanical smoke completed before
the full batch. No model setting changed.

## Decision

ECP7-B1-I is recorded as a negative development result. The confirmatory split
remains sealed and no `config/ecp7.yaml` is created. A second development batch
may test one preregistered intervention aimed at code utilization without
restoring a factor-to-slot binding; it must receive a new variant identifier
before any training run.
